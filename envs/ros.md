## vsctool
It's **NOT** the same as the vcs installed via homebrew.

Install via python on Mac, instructions are [here](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool). Works on m1 chip.
If it's not working, then **uninstall** it and install using sudo.
```bash
sudo pip install vcstool
# or sudo python -m pip install vcstool
```
